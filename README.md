# txmsg-r
A program to scan the ethereum blockchain for embedded messages and graffiti.

This current program was generated by AI. It is not perfect but it is a functional baseline. I will go through it at some point and
rewrite it from the ground up by hand.

Note to future self: To filter out junk messages, try using some sort of statistical dataset that is trained off of examples of junk messages. Alternatively, try and decode what is actually behind and causing them and filter them that way.
